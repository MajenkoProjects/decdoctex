\newpage
\section{Resistor Load Board Removal from System Box}

The resistor load board loads down the power supply in a diskless system
or when just the RX33 floppy drive is installed in the system box. The
power supply does not have enough of a load on it to regulate properly
in these configurations. The load board simulates the drives by drawing
enough power to regulate the power supply. You must remove the load
board whenever a hard disk drive is installed in the system box.

The resistor load board in the system box is different from the resistor load
board in the expansion boxes. The part number of the resistor load board in
the system box must be 5417163-02. The -01 version goes in the expansion
boxes.

\begin{enumerate}

\item	Remove the shield (\para{3.2}).

\item	Remove the three screws shown in \figref{3-29} that secure the drive
		mounting bracket to the chassis.

\item	Disconnect the power cable from the resistor load board.

\item	Lift the load board up and out of the chassis.

\item	If you are removing the load board to install a drive, remove and 
		discard the standoffs that the load board sat on, then install the drive by
		reversing the removal instructions for that drive. Otherwise, install the
		new load board (p/n 5417163-02) by reversing the above procedures.

fully charge the battery. If the battery's charge is low, you will see an error for
the NVR when you power up the system.}

\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\section{Power Supply Removal from the System Box}

\section{Expansion Adapter Removal}

The expansion adapter is not an FRU. There is one FRU module located
inside the expansion adapter called the disk interface module. There is
also an interface cable for the tape drive expansion box that passes through
the expansion adapter and attaches directly to connector A on the back
of the expansion adapter. Removal procedures for the expansion adapter
are below. The removal and replacement Information for the disk interface
module is in \para{3.16.1}.

\section{VAXstation 2000 and MicroVAX 2000 Expansion Box}

There are two configurations of expansion boxes and both configurations
are available for the VAXstation 2000 and MicroVAX 2000 systems. One
configuration consists of an RD53 hard disk drive in an expansion box
for 70 megabytes of storage memory. Another configuration consists of
a TK50 tape drive with a TZK50 controller board in an expansion box for
94.5 megabytes of storage memory.

The expansion box with the hard disk contains five FRUs. They are the
disk, disk device electronics board inside the disk, a resistor load board,
the power supply, and the expansion box itself. The expansion box with the
tape drive also contains five FRUs. They are the TK50 tape drive, TZK50
controller board, a resistor load board, the power supply, and the expansion
box itself.

Paragraph 3.17.1 contains removal procedures for the hard disk drive ex
pansion box and Paragraph 3.17.2 contains removal procedures for the tape
drive expansion box.
