\usection{Setting Up the Color or Gray-Scale 4-Plane Graphics Option}

If you have a monochrome monitor, use the instructions in this guide to
install a color cable (packaged in the Upgrade kit) on the monitor.
 If you ordered a new monitor with your Upgrade kit, first set it up as described in
the monitor installation documentation, packaged with the monitor.
 Then, after the Option is installed, follow the instructions in this guide.

The VAXstation 2000 4-plane graphics coprocessor provides a 4-plane video
Subsystem for the VAXstation 2000 System. This raster scan video Subsystem
provides a resolution of 1024 by 864 pixels, and displays up to 16 gray-scales
or 16 colors from a palette of 4096.

A bitmap display provides variable character size or positioning and inherent
graphics capability. The display provides about 850,000 pixels refreshed on
the screen at 60 Hertz, thus preventing the flicker and smear of an interlaced
display.

\usection{Installing the Video Cable Assembly on a Monochrome Monitor}

If you have a VR260 or VR150 monochrome monitor with a 4-plane graphics
coprocessor to display gray-scale on your screen, you will need to install a
color video cable assembly on your monitor.

First, locate the video cable assembly shown in Figure 1 (part no. BC19S).
\fig{MLO-1263-87}{Color Video Cable Assembly, BC19S}

The following sections describe the installation process for the VR260 and
VR150 respectively.

\usubsection{VR260 Monochrome Monitor with 4-Plane Graphics Coprocessor}

\textbf{Note: If you plan to connect the printer and modern cables, leave the
cable-restraining bar up until you have connected those options.}
\item Connect the end of the BC19S video cable to the video port on the rear
of the VAXstation 2000 System unit.
 The video port is identified by a
video icon. Insert the cable with the video-icon side of the monitor cable
facing you.
\item Tighten the thumbscrews on the monitor video cable by turning them
clockwise with your hngers (Figure 7).
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Caution: Before connecting the monitor cable to the System, make sure
the system's power supply is turned off.}

\usection{Testing Your System}
The VAXstation 2000 diagnostic tests are stored in the VAXstation 2000 read-
only memory. After every power up, the VAXstation 2000 automatically Starts
the System tests, which check the components of your System. The following
section describes some of the diagnostic tests available on the VAXstation
2000.
 For more information, see the \textit{VAXstation 2000 Hardware Installation
Guide.}

If you are going to perform diagnostic tests, make sure that both the monitor
and System unit power supplies are turned on.

\usubsection{A Note on Diagnostics}
In diagnostics, a Single question mark precedes additional Status information.
An example of Status information is:

{\tt ? 4 00D0  0009.0213}

This example indicates that there is a 4-plane coprocessor present in the
System with a monochrome monitor and a color cable.

If the 4-plane module has a fatal error, the monitor screen will remain blank.

\textbf{Note: If your monitor does not display any information on the screen after
the power-up test sequence, you may have a failure in your video board
and/or other failures.  Check the LEDs on your keyboard for secondary
power-up error messages. If any of the LEDs in Table 1 are lit, call your
service representative.}

\begin{table}[H]
\label{table:1}

\end{itemize}

\usubsection{Restarting the System After Running Tests}

While you are running any of the tests or procedures in this chapter, you are
in console mode. To resume normal Operation of the VAXstation 2000, you
must reenter program mode. The two ways to do this are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Type \textbf{BOOT} at the console prompt and press Retum. The System then
searches each device in turn for operating System Software.

\item Type \textbf{BOOT} followed by a space and the name of the device that
contains operating System Software and then press Return, as shown in
this example:

{\tt >>> BOOT DUA0}

This procedure lets the System boot the operating System Software immediately, without searching.

\end{enumerate}
